# TME wide communications in ER+ Breast cancer

This repository contains code written to analyze the communications received by focal cells from phenotypically diverse populations of cancer and non-cancer cells with the tumor microenvironment (TME). Serial tumor biopsies from patients from the FELINE clinical trial were analyzed using single cell RNA-seq (scRNAseq). Two cohorts of patients were independently examined, with the first discovery cohort used to identify cellular TME communication promoting treatment resistance. The second cohort was used to validate discoveries and critical predictions.
